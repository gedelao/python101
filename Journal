# My Thoughts on Python

After completing Python, I can honestly say that the process was a mixed bag. Being able to use print, if, input, return, break and etc. 
made sense, but there are moments still didn't make much sense such as while and for loops. I belive that it was due to more of overthinking
it when differentiating them. I believe that going over the older video lectures and taking it step by step will better help me understand it.
Apart from that, I enjoyed getting to learn python and being able to add it to my list of skills. The project itself was fun as it allowed us all
to show our creativity just using what we learned. I'm not too sure how popular python is in Houston, but I can at least let interviewers know about
my cool Pokemon game. :)
